- For your IGV screenshot, it might be a little easier to read / more informative if you zoom in a little next time   
- Think about your axes (for all plots) and bin numbers (for the histograms) - would increasing/lengthening them in either direction make the difference between E4 and E5 more obvious? 

nicely done! 5/5
