Regrade 12/6/21 - SC 
Looks great, Brad, thanks for making those changes! 6/6

- For the first plot, allele frequency should start at 0.5 (-1) 
- for the last plot, I think selection coefficient should be between -0.5 and +0.5 (-1) can you redo this? 

4/6

-Changed first plot to allele frequency of 0.5 (100 alleles of 200 total (from 100 individuals))
